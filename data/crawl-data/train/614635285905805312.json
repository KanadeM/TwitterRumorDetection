Flawless instincts and unconventional thinking help earn House great respect, despite his brutal honesty and antisocial tendencies."}}], "in_reply_to_user_id": "17004618", "reply_settings": "everyone", "id": "614635285905805312", "possibly_sensitive": false, "created_at": "2015-06-27T03:24:06.000Z", "text": "@NickKristof @robertbenzie Awesome!
